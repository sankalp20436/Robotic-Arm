The  popularity  of  using  robots  in  industries  and factories instead of human workers has seen a high rise. Through this work we  have attempted  to make an  alternative system  of human  for  reducing  the  human  labor  by  using  simple  and available components. This robotic system is controlled by a user through joystick or for accuracy via numpad by entering the angle of rotation manually. By the use of the joystick the user can operate and the robotic arm. It will move from one place to another according to the command of the user and pick the desired object and place it for the user. This design of the robot is  easy,  cheap  and  versatile,  making  it  a  great  commercial candidate.  With  the  increasing  use  of  this  kinds  of  robot  the production  rate will  increase  and  the  number of  mishaps  will decrease.
